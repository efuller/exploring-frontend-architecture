# Exploring Frontend Architecture
This is a small frontend application that was built to explore different variations of frontend architecture.

You can check it out [ï»¿here](https://exploring-frontend-architecture.onrender.com/).

## Concepts Explored
- Using Puppeteer for E2E acceptance testing
- Using a Page Object Model to make E2E less volatile and more declarative
- Application level acceptance testing
- Cucumber + Gherkins
- Composition Root Pattern
- Reactivity via a custom observer
- Outgoing contract test to ensure our inMemory client storage stub works as intended
- Use Presenters to wire up the UI Framework to the application state
- Use Controllers to perform application use cases
- Use the concept of a Repository to manage and act upon global application state
- Utilize Dependency Inversion to interface with a Client Storage Repository. This allows us to create a proper stub for testing
## Functionality
- A user can add a journal entry
- A user can delete a journal entry
- A user can favorite a journal entry
- Favorites are saved to local storage. State is hydrated from the favorites stored in local storage upload load.
- When a favorite is deleted, the user will have to confirm deletion
